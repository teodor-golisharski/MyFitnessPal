MyFitnessPal is a user-friendly application designed to help individuals monitor their fitness journey by tracking calorie intake, exercise routines, and overall progress. Developed as part of the Introduction to Programming practicum course, this project introduces essential programming concepts while providing practical functionality for everyday use.

## Key Features:
* Calorie Tracking: Users can log daily meals, along with calorie information, to track their intake.
* Exercise Logging: Add and manage workout routines to monitor burned calories or progress toward fitness goals.
* Daily Summary: Generate a concise report of calorie intake, burned calories, and net balance.
* Progress Tracking: Save user progress across sessions using local text files.

## Technical Limitations:
To align with the course objectives and encourage mastery of core programming techniques, the following constraints are in place:
* Programming Paradigm: The application avoids Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques and adheres to procedural programming principles.
* Libraries and Tools: The implementation is limited to the following C++ standard libraries:
** iostream: For console input/output operations.
** ctime: To handle and format dates and times.
** string: For manipulating and processing text-based data.
** vector: To store and manage dynamic collections of data.
** fstream: To read from and write to local files for data persistence.
